# Library Project

A simple web application for managing a personal book collection. This project was built as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum.

## Features

- **Add Books:** Easily add new books with their title, author, number of pages, and read status through a simple modal form.
- **View Library:** All books are displayed in a clean, organized table.
- **Update Status:** Toggle the read status of a book directly from the library view.
- **Remove Books:** Delete books from the library with a confirmation prompt.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your library is saved to the browser's local storage, so your collection persists between sessions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
